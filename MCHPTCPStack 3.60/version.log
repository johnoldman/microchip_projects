v3.60		12 July 2006
********
General Information:
This stack version is being publicly released, so the following changes are with 
respect to the prior public stack release (v3.02).  Interim stack changes for version
3.16 and 3.50 are documented below for those using non-public releases, but can be 
ignored by most people.


Troubleshooting notes:
1. If you have an Ethernet PICtail revision 2.1 and are having reliability issues when 
   viewing the fast-refresh demo web page, you may need to install resistors in series 
   with the ENC28J60 SI, nCS, and SCK pins.  The recommended value is 100 to 200 ohms. 
   This will reduce signal undershoot caused by long traces (parasitic inductance), 
   which can violate the absolute maximum electrical specs and cause SPI data 
   corruption.  The HPC Explorer Rev 5 has fairly long traces to the PICtail connector.
2. Enabling C30 2.02 compiler optimizations on the dsPIC33FJ256GP710, PIC24HJ256GP610 
   ES chips may produce unreliable code.
3. When changing a C30 project to a PIC24H or dsPIC33F processor on the Explorer 16 
   demo board, the JTAG configuration fuse should be disabled to free the I/O pins 
   associated with it.  JTAG is enabled by default.
4. This stack release was tested using MPLAB 7.40, C18 version 3.03, C30 version 2.02, 
   and HI TECH PICC18 version 9.50PL1.
5. When using the Ethernet PICtail board and HPC Explorer demo boards, make sure to 
   plug the power into the Ethernet PICtail and not the HPC Explorer.  The HPC 
   Explorer's power regulator cannot provide enough current.


Changes:
1. Source files have been split into separate directories.  To compile old 
   applications with this new stack, application source files may need to be updated 
   to include the proper path to the stack header files.
2. New MPLAB projects have been created:
   -C18EEPROM: Equivalent to the previously named "mpnicee" project.  Designed for 
               PIC18's using the C18 compiler.  Web page content, board's IP address, 
               MAC address, DHCP enabled state, etc. is stored in an external SPI 
               EEPROM (25LC256 on demo boards).  FTP Server demo is included.
   -C30EEPROM: New supporting PIC24 and dsPIC controllers using the C30 compiler.  
               Similar to C18EEPROM.
   -C18ProgramMem: Equivalent to the previously named "mpnicpg" project.  Web page 
                   content stored in internal FLASH program memory.  Board's IP 
                   address, MAC address, DHCP enabled state, etc. is stored only in 
                   RAM and defaults are loaded from MY_DEFAULT_* constants in 
                   StackTsk.h.  FTP Server demo is not included.  Web pages cannot be 
                   updated remotely.
   -C30ProgramMem: New supporting PIC24 and dsPIC controllers using the C30 compiler.  
                   Similar to C18ProgramMem.
   -HTC18EEPROM: Equivalent to the previously named "htnicee" project.  Designed for 
                 PIC18's using the HI TECH PICC18 compiler.  Similar to C18EEPROM.
   -HTC18ProgramMem: Equivalent to the previously named "htnicpg" project.  Designed 
                     for PIC18's using the HI TECH PICC18 compiler.  Similar to 
                     C18ProgramMem.
3. Created hardware definitions (pins, interrupt flags, special registers, etc) in 
   Compiler.h for easy changing of hardware.  Four demo board combinations are 
   supported out-of-box now:
	-EXPLORER_16: Explorer 16 motherboard + Ethernet PICtail Plus daughter card.  
                      Tested with dsPIC33FJ256GP710, PIC24HJ256GP610, and 
                      PIC24F128GA010 ES PIMs.
	-HPC_EXPLORER: PICDEM HPC Explorer motherboard + Ethernet PICtail daughter 
                       card.  Tested with PIC18F8722 onboard and PIC18F87J10 PIM.
	-DSPICDEM11: dsPICDEM 1.1 motherboard + Ethernet PICtail daughter card 
                     (manually air wired).  See Compiler.h for proper pins to air wire.  
                     Tested with dsPIC30F6014A PIM.
	-PICDEMNET2: PICDEM.net 2 motherboard (PIC18F97J60)
   Change boards by changing the defined macro (Project -> Build Options... -> 
   Project -> MPLAB Cxx -> Add macro).  When moving to custom hardware, add an  
   appropriate profile to Compiler.h.  YOUR_BOARD is present as a placeholder.
4. Added Ethernet PICtail Plus schematic (reference ENC28J60 daughter card design for
   Explorer 16 demo board).  These boards have a Microchip part number of AC164123.
5. Latest ENC28J60 rev. B5 errata workarounds added.  The code checks the EREVID 
   register and implements the appropriate workarounds as needed for the silicon 
   revision, so rev. B1, B4, and B5 are all supported in this stack release.
6. Significantly revised demonstration web page content in WebPages folder to use 
   AJAX technology.  Using asynchronous JavaScript code executing in the web browser,
   the status sections of the page are updated rapidly from the web server without 
   doing a full page refresh.  As a result, a virtually real time update of the 
   potentiometer and button values can be displayed.  Due to the constant use of new 
   TCP sockets, multiple simultaneous users are not recommended.  See the Index.cgi 
   file for a simple static method of retrieving dynamic variables from the HTTP 
   server.
7. Changed IP Gleaning procedure.  Now, if DHCP is enabled, the DHCP module will 
   continue to look for a new IP address/renew existing IP address if the IP address 
   is configured using IP Gleaning.  Previously, the DHCP module would be disabled 
   once a successful ICMP packet was received and used to configure the IP address.
8. MAX_RETRY_COUNTS is 3 (previously it was 3, but an interim release changed it to 5).
9. Updated TCP state machine.  It now includes the TCP_FIN_WAIT_2 state.  Some other 
   changes were made to handle errors more robustly.
10.AN0String and AN1String now return all characters excluding the null terminator 
   when the HTTP server calls HTTPGetVar (except when the string is 0 length).  
   Previously, the null terminator was returned as well.
11.Dynamic pages (ie: .cgi files) are now served with an expired HTTP header to 
   prevent browser caching and allow more dynamic content to be displayed.
12.Support for the HI TECH PICC18 compiler has changed.  Special Function Register 
   bits and other definitions have changed substantially from the previous HI TECH 
   PICC18 projects in TCP/IP stack version 3.02 and earlier.  The C18/C30 SFR and 
   SFRbits naming conventions are now used and special remapping macros in Compiler.h 
   are used to maintain a consistent syntax.  The HI TECH PICC18 projects were tested 
   with compiler version 9.50PL1 on the HPC Explorer board (PIC18F8722).
13.FTP client hash printing has been added to the FTP server.  Now, whenever a chunk 
   of data is successfully uploaded to the device, a '#' character will appear on the 
   FTP client screen.  The numbers of bytes each '#' represents is variable.
14.To improve maintainability, built in support for the "Compatible" A/D converter 
   present on older PIC18 parts (ex: PIC18F452) has been removed.
15.Removed old LCD code originally provided for the PICDEM.net demo board.
16.Added LCDBlocking.c and LCDBlocking.h, which implement simple routines for writing 
   to the LCD module on the Explorer 16 and PICDEM.net 2 development boards.  The LCD 
   on the dsPICDEM 1.1 board is not supported.  The stack version and IP address are 
   shown on the LCD on power up.
17.UART functions in MainDemo.c were replaced with C18 and C30 peripheral library 
   functions.  However, because the UART peripheral libraries are not being updated 
   for newer silicon devices, the code was copied into UART.c and is compiled with 
   the stack.
18.Multiple TX buffer support has been implemented.  Most stack layers have been 
   touched.  ENC28J60.c has the most extensive changes.  Each socket may use only one
   TX buffer.
19.Implemented TCP retransmission support regardless of if TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is 
   defined or not.
20.TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK in StackTsk.h has been undefined by default.  This should 
   increase default TCP connection robustness.  Packets sent from the stack to the 
   remote node will now be detected and retransmitted if lost or corrupted.
21.All TCP packets are now retransmitted immediately after being initially transmitted 
   when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is undefined.  This improves throughput greatly when 
   communicating with systems which wait a long time before transmitting ACKs.  TCP/IP 
   stacks, such as that used by Microsoft Windows, implement the TCP Delayed 
   Acknowledgement algorithm, which is why this retransmission is necessary for high 
   performance.  The double transmission feature can be disabled in the Microchip 
   TCP/IP stack by defining "DEBUG" either in the TCP.c file or the project compiler 
   macros section.  Using DEBUG mode can be useful when trying to look for errors 
   using Ethreal [ http://www.ethereal/ ].
22.Lowered TCP_START_TIMEOUT_VAL from 60 seconds to 3 seconds.  60 seconds is an 
   unreasonably long timeout for modern day network speeds.
23.Native support for the SLIP module has been dropped.



Fixes:
1. A new IP address obtained via IP Gleaning will now update the LCD (if present), 
   invoke the Announce module (for MCHPDetect.exe), and output the new address out 
   the RS232 port.
2. DHCP client will now correctly use the first DHCP offer received when connected 
   to a network running multiple DHCP servers.  Previously, the board would get no
   IP address when attached to a network with multiple DHCP servers (unless the DHCP 
   request was transmitted before a second DHCP offer was received -- a relatively 
   rare event).  Additionally, DHCPLeaseTime does not get reset to 60 seconds or 
   the value stored in the last DHCP packet received prior to receiving the ACK.
3. UDPProces() will now correctly process received UDP packets that have a 0x0000 
   checksum field.  The UDP protocol specifies that 0x0000 means the checksum is 
   disabled.  Packets with a 0x0000 checksum were previously thrown away unless the 
   calculated checksum also happened to be 0x0000.
4. The TCPIsPutReady() function will now honor the remote node's TCP window size.  In 
   other words, if the remote application pauses or cannot handle the incoming data 
   rate, the TCP flow control feature will correctly function.  Previously, if the 
   remote node ran out of incoming buffer memory, the TCP layer would still allow 
   more data to be transmitted.  This would result in the loss or corruption of 
   application data, with a potentially broken connection.  The change requires 2 more
   bytes of RAM per TCP socket (TCB array).


Known Problems:
1. On PICDEM.net 2 board ENC28J60 and 25LC256 EEPROM share the same SPI1 module.  At 
   3.3V, the 25LC256 is only rated to 5MHz SPI clock, but the code is setting it to 
   10.4MHz because the MACInit() function reconfigures the same SPI1 module.
2. DHCP will continually send out DHCP Request packets when the lease expires and the 
   original DHCP server that gave the lease is offline.  The board will continue to 
   use the expired IP address until the DHCP server comes back online, at which point 
   the lease will be renewed or a new discovery will occur.  A new discovery should
   occur after timing out, instead.  It is believe that this problem has always 
   existed in previous stack revisions.
3. DHCP will continually send out DHCP Request packets when the lease expires and the 
   original DHCP server that gave the lease does not include Option 54, the Server 
   Identifier.  A new discovery should occur after timing out.  It is believe that 
   this problem has always existed in previous stack revisions.
4. The MPFS utility has not been updated.  When creating a .c image file, the include 
   path for the Compiler.h file will be incorrect and need to be manually updated to
   "..\Include\Compiler.h".
5. When an MPFS .c image file is added to a C30 project, a linking error reporting 
   insufficient contiguous .const memory may occur when too much data is in the MPFS 
   image (PSV window size limitation).  Using the PSV window, 1 out of every 3 program 
   memory bytes is wasted.
6. MACSetPMFilter(), MACDisablePMFilter(), and MACCopyRxToTx() have not been tested 
   and possibly do not work.
7. SNMP, TFTPc modules have not been tested with this version.
8. Serial numbers >32K will be displayed on the serial port as a negative value when 
   C18 is used and the board is placed in configuration mode (RB0 button is depressed 
   on power up).
9. IP Gleaning may not get disabled when, through the RS232 configuration application, 
   DHCP and IP Gleaning are disabled.
10.The C30 linker may misplace the __CONFIG2 section or disallow usage of MPFS images 
   that are too big (add too much to the .const code section).  The consequences of 
   this are that the first configuration word at 0x157FC may not get set through code 
   (must use the Configuration Bits dialog instead), and/or the project will not 
   compile.  This problem has been observed with C30 ver. 2.02 on the PIC24FJ128GA010 
   product.  To work around this problem, the p24FJ128GA010.gld linker script has 
   been modified.  Specifically, line 68 has been commented out, which causes the 
   linker to place all .text sections after placing all absolute sections.  SSR 25966 
   in the C30 2.02 release notes may be related.


Guiding Notes:
1. To change processors using a C18* project:
   -Change the processor in the MPLAB IDE
   -Change linker script (ex: 18f87j10i.lkr) in the MPLAB project.  Use *i.lkr 
    if the ICD2 is going to be used to debug with.
   -Update the hardware definitions in Compiler.h or change your demo board 
    selection macro.  (Project -> Build Options... -> Project -> MPLAB Cxx -> 
    PICDEMNET2, etc)
2. To change processors using a HTC18* project:
   -Change the processor in the MPLAB IDE
   -Update the hardware definitions in Compiler.h or change your demo board 
    selection macro.  (Project -> Build Options... -> Project -> MPLAB Cxx -> 
    PICDEMNET2, etc)
3. To change processors using a C30* project:
   -Change the processor in the MPLAB IDE
   -Change linker script (ex: p33FJ256GP710.gld) in the MPLAB project.  
   -Update the hardware definitions in Compiler.h or change your demo board 
    selection macro.  (Project -> Build Options... -> Project -> MPLAB Cxx -> 
    DSPICDEM11, etc)
   -Disable JTAG configuration fuse, if enabled
4. When using the PICDEM.net 2 board, to write code targeting the PIC18F97J60 family
   Ethernet module:
   -Remove ENC28J60.c from the project
   -Add ETH97J60.c to the project
   -Plug the Ethernet cable into the left-most RJ45 jack (next to LCD)
5. When using the PICDEM.net 2 board, to write code targeting the ENC28J60 Ethernet 
   device:
   -Make sure ENC28J60.c is in the project
   -Make sure that ETH97J60.c is not in the project
   -Plug the Ethernet cable into the right-most RJ45 jack (next to board edge)
6. When using the PICDEM.net 2 board, to write code targeting an Ethernet PICtail 
   module (ENC28J60):
   -Make sure ENC28J60.c is in the project
   -Make sure that ETH97J60.c is not in the project
   -Make sure that the Ethernet PICtail J9 jumper is in the 2-3 position (default).
   -Properly update the hardware profile in Compiler.h.  ENC_CS_TRIS and ENC_CS_IO 
    need to be changed from D3 to B3.
   -Plug the Ethernet cable into the PICtail
   -Plug power into the PICDEM.net 2 board
7. When using the Explorer 16 and Ethernet PICtail Plus demo boards, make sure to mate 
   the PICtail to the motherboard using the topmost socket position, leaving the cable 
   hanging over prototyping area.  If SPI2 is desired, the PICtail should have the 
   same orientation but be installed in the middle slot.  Using SPI2, the hardware 
   profile will need to be updated in Compiler.h.



********
v3.50		13 April 2006
********
Changes:
1. Improved dsPIC33F and PIC24H support.  UART functions are included now instead of 
   precompiled object files for the PIC24F.  The 12-bit A/D converter is now shown in 
   use on the demo web content.  When changing a C30 project to a PIC24H or dsPIC33F 
   processor on the Explorer 16 demo board, the JTAG configuration fuse should be 
   disabled to free the I/O pins associated with it.  JTAG is enabled by default.
2. Added LCDBlocking.c and LCDBlocking.h, which implement simple routines for writing 
   to the LCD module on the Explorer 16 development board.  The stack version and IP 
   address are shown on the LCD on power up.
3. Added "C18ProgramMem" and "C30ProgramMem" MPLAB projects for MPFS storage (web page 
   content) on on-chip program memory.  These projects are equivalent to the previously 
   named "mpnicpg" project in prior stack releases.
4. Multiple TX buffer support has been implemented.  Most stack layers have been 
   touched.  ENC28J60.c has the most extensive changes.  Each socket may use only one
   TX buffer.
5. Implemented TCP retransmission support when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is undefined.
6. TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK in StackTsk.h has been undefined by default.  This should 
   increase default TCP connection robustness.
7. All TCP packets are now retransmitted immediately after being initially transmitted 
   when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is undefined.  This improves throughput greatly when 
   communicating with systems which wait a long time before transmitting ACKs.
8. Lowered TCP_START_TIMEOUT_VAL from 60 seconds to 3 seconds.
9. Increased MAX_RETRY_COUNTS from 3 to 5 times.
10. The example HTTP server now returns a content expiration date which has already 
    past.  This prevents web browser caching and allows more dynamic content to be 
    displayed.
11. Added WebPages_JScript folder, with new web pages that support dynamic page updates 
    without a full page reload.  A tiny page of dynamic variables is returned by the 
    web server and Javascript executing on the target web browser changes DOM elements 
    as needed.  Button S5 (RA7) on the Explorer 16 demo board and S1 (RB0) on the HPC 
    Explorer demo board changes the page color scheme.  The rapid dynamic updates do 
    not work on some web browsers (Internet Explorer works, Firefox does not).


Known Problems:
1. MPFS utility has not been updated.  When creating a .c image file, the include path
   for the compiler.h file will be incorrect and need to be manually updated.
2. When an MPFS .c image file is added to a C30 project, a linking error reporting 
   insufficient contiguous .const memory may occur (PSV window size limitation).
3. MACSetPMFilter(), MACDisablePMFilter(), and MACCopyRxToTx() have not been tested and 
   possibly do not work.
4. SNMP, TFTPc, SLIP modules have not been tested with this version.
5. Serial numbers >32K will be displayed on the serial port as a negative value when 
   C18 is used and the board is placed in configuration mode (RB0 button is depressed 
   on power up).
6. IP Gleaning may not get disabled when, through the RS232 configuration application, 
   DHCP and IP Gleaning are disabled.
7. The IP address being outputted out the RS232 port and through the Announce module 
   does not happen when the IP address is configured using IP Gleaning.
8. On the PIC24F with C30 compiler optimizations enabled (such as Option 3, maximum 
   speed), the project may not work.  The PIC24F headers that come with C30 ver. 2.01 
   declare several SFRs without using the volatile keyword.
9. dsPIC30 support is incomplete.  Currently PIC18, PIC24F, PIC24H, and dsPIC33F 
   processors are supported.  



********
v3.16.00:       06 March 2006
********
Changes:
1. Added unified support for both the Microchip C18 and C30 compilers.  The intention
   is to allow one code base to be compiled for any PIC18, PIC24F/H, dsPIC30, or 
   dsPIC33 product (with adequate memory).  See the "Tested Using" section for what is
   known to work.
2. To improve maintainability, support for the HI-TECH PICC18 compiler has been 
   dropped.
3. New project workspaces have been created, "C30EEPROM.mcw" and "C18EEPROM.mcw".  
   C18EEPROM.mcw is equivalent to the previously named "mpnicee.mcw."  C30EEPROM is 
   intended to be used for PIC24 and dsPIC 16-bit controllers.
4. Source files have been split into separate directories.
5. Latest ENC28J60 rev. B5 errata workarounds added.  The code checks the EREVID 
   register and implements the appropriate workarounds as needed for the silicon 
   revision, so rev. B1, B4, and B5 are all supported in this stack release.
6. Removed old LCD code originally provided for the PICDEM.net demo board.
7. To improve maintainability, built in support for the "Compatable" A/D converter 
   present on older PIC18 parts (ex: PIC18F452) has been removed.
8. UART functions in MainDemo.c were replaced with C18 and C30 peripheral library 
   functions.

Tested Using:
1. Software:
   -MPLAB version 7.31.01
   -C18 version 3.02
   -C30 version 2.01
2. Hardware:
   -PICDEM HPC Explorer rev. 4 (PIC18F8722) + Ethernet PICtail Daughter Board (ENC28J60 
B1)
   -Explorer 16 rev. 4 (PIC24FJ128GA010 ES and dsPIC33FJ256GP710 ES) + Ethernet PICtail+ 
    Daughter card (ENC28J60 B1).
3. Notes:
   -MPLAB 7.31.01 is a development build.  The publicly available version 7.31 
    should work fine, with the exception of being unable to program dsPIC33 and PIC24H
    parts with the ICD 2.
   -No dsPIC30 or PIC24H parts have been tested yet.

Known Problems:
1. MPFS utility has not been updated.  When creating a .c image file, the include path
   for the compiler.h file will be incorrect and need to be manually updated.
2. When an MPFS .c image file is added to a C30 project, a linking error reporting 
   insufficient contiguous .const memory may occur.
3. On the PIC24FJ128GA010, it is observed that some inbound packets are lost from time 
   to time with no anticipated reason.
4. MACSetPMFilter(), MACDisablePMFilter(), and MACCopyRxToTx() have not been tested and 
   possibly do not work.
5. SNMP, TFTPc, SLIP modules have not been tested with this version.
6. Serial numbers >32K will be displayed on the serial port as a negative value when 
   C18 is used and the board is placed in configuration mode (RB0 button is depressed 
   on power up).
7. IP Gleaning may not get disabled when, through the RS232 configuration application, 
   DHCP and IP Gleaning are disabled.
8. The IP address being outputted out the RS232 port and through the Announce module 
   does not happen when the IP address is configured using IP Gleaning.
9. Multiple TX buffer support is not fully inplemented in the MAC layer, ENC28J60.c.  
   Stack behavior when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is undefined may be unexpected.



********
v3.02.00:       20 Feb 2006
********
Fixes:
1. Changed TXSTART in ENC28J60.c to stop wasting a byte.
2. Changed RXSTOP in ENC28J60.c to always be an odd value to properly implement an 
   ENC28J60 silicon errata workaround.
3. Changed initialization of ERXRDPT in MACInit() to agree with the current errata.

Changes:
1. Licence agreement
2. Schematics and other board files to the Ethernet PICtail Daughter Board have been 
   updated to revision 5.  Of significant note, the nRESET pin has been freed and 
   200 ohm resistors were added to the ENC28J60 SI, nCS, and SCK pins.  The added 
   resistors reduce undershoot caused by stray trace inductance and strong host output
   drivers.

Known Problems:
1. Testing on the PICDEM.net demo board with the Realtek RTL8019AS Ethernet controller 
   has not been done.  Moving to the HPC Explorer demo board has resulted in pinout 
   and other hardware changes.
2. MACSetPMFilter(), MACDisablePMFilter(), and MACCopyRxToTx() have not been tested and 
   possibly do not work.
3. SNMP, TFTPc, LCD, SLIP modules have not been tested with this version.
4. The stack may behave incorrectly if compiled using the Hitech compiler with a high 
   optimizations setting.
5. Serial numbers >32K will be displayed on the serial port as a negative value when 
   C18 is used and the board is placed in configuration mode (RB0 button is depressed 
   on power up).
6. IP Gleaning may not get disabled when, through the RS232 configuration application, 
   DHCP and IP Gleaning are disabled.
7. The IP address being outputted out the RS232 port and through the Announce module 
   does not happen when the IP address is configured using IP Gleaning.
8. Multiple TX buffer support is not fully inplemented in the MAC layer, ENC28J60.c.  
   Stack behavior when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is undefined may be unexpected.


********
v3.01.00:       18 Jan 2006
********
Fixes:
1. Implemented latest ENC28J60 silicon errata workarounds.
2. Fixed a bug in TCP.c and UDP.c which would incorrectly write the packet checksum 
   into the RX buffer incorrectly when the checksum field was exactly spanning the RX 
   wrapparound boundary in the ENC28J60.  This problem would have caused packets to be 
   discarded in rare circumstances


Known Problems:
1. Testing on the PICDEM.net demo board with the Realtek RTL8019AS Ethernet controller 
   has not been done.  Moving to the HPC Explorer demo board has resulted in pinout 
   and other hardware changes.
2. MACSetPMFilter(), MACDisablePMFilter(), and MACCopyRxToTx() have not been tested and 
   possibly do not work.
3. SNMP, TFTPc, LCD, SLIP modules have not been tested with this version.
4. The stack may behave incorrectly if compiled using the Hitech compiler with a high 
   optimizations setting.
5. Serial numbers >32K will be displayed on the serial port as a negative value when 
   C18 is used and the board is placed in configuration mode (RB0 button is depressed 
   on power up).
6. IP Gleaning may not get disabled when, through the RS232 configuration application, 
   DHCP and IP Gleaning are disabled.
7. The IP address being outputted out the RS232 port and through the Announce module 
   does not happen when the IP address is configured using IP Gleaning.
8. Multiple TX buffer support is not fully inplemented in the MAC layer, ENC28J60.c.  
   Stack behavior when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is defined may be unexpected.


********
v3.00.00:       16 Jan 2006
********
Changes:
1. The stack now targets the PICDEM HPC Explorer demo board (PIC18F8722 MCU) with an 
   attached Ethernet PICtail Daughter Board (with the Microchip ENC28J60 Ethernet 
   controller).
2. IP Gleaning is no longer enabled (STACK_USE_IP_GLEANING is not defined) by any of 
   the default project files.
3. The IP address, whenever it changes, is outputted out the RS232 serial port in 
   human readable form.  Any terminal program, such as HyperTerminal can be used to 
   read it.  This allows the IP address to be easily determined when DHCP is used.  
   The serial port defaults to 19200 baud when CLOCK_FREQ in Compiler.h is properly 
   defined.


Additions:
1. Microchip ENC28J60 Ethernet controller support.  Support is included through the 
   ENC28J60.c and ENC28J60.h files.  Various other files were modified to take 
   advantage of ENC28J60 specific features, like the hardware DMA/IP checksum engine.  
   This new MAC driver incorporates several new functions which can be called from any 
   layer above the MAC.  The functions are:
      MACSetDuplex()
      MACPowerDown()
      MACPowerUp()
      MACSetPMFilter()
      MACDisablePMFilter()
      CalcIPBufferChecksum()
      MACCalcRxChecksum()
      MACCalcTxChecksum()
      MACCopyRxToTx()
   See the ENC28J60.c file comments for function descriptions.  The ENC28J60.c file 
   also incroporates TestMemory() which can do a power on self test of various hardware 
   functions.  TestMemory() is included and used when MAC_POWER_ON_TEST is defined in 
   StackTsk.h.  It is undefined by default.  Defining it will require some program 
   memory.
2. Announce module.  Announce.c and announce.h have been added.  When included in the 
   project, STACK_USE_ANNOUNCE must be defined.  This module will broadcast a UDP 
   message to port 30303 containing the local MAC address whenever the local IP 
   address changes.  This addition is intended to facilitate device discovery on DHCP 
   enabled networks and eliminate the need for an RS232 connection if board 
   reconfiguration is not needed. To retrieve the UDP message on your computer, use 
   the new MCHPDetect.exe program included in the \MCHPDetect subfolder.
3. The spieeprom.c file was added to support SPI EEPROM chips for MPFS storage.  
   ENC28J60.c and spieeprom.c may both be included and they will share the same SPI 
   module.


Improvements:
1. Renamed files/edited files so that the HI-TECH compiler won't raise messages stating 
   that include files were spelled wrong.
2. Moved MAX_ICMP_DATA_LEN from StackTsk.c to ICMP.h file for easier maintenance.
3. Corrected STACK_USE_SIIP typo in dhcp.c file - Thanks to Gisle J.B.
4. Implemented UDP checksum logic in UDPProcess() in UDP.c file.
5. Renamed CalcTCPChecksum() in tcp.c file to CalcIPBufferChecksum().
6. Moved CalcIPBufferChecksum() to helpers.c to reuse it for UDP checksum calculation.
7. Modified UDPProcess() in UDP.c and TCPProcess() in TCP.c to include localIP as third 
   new parameter. This makes pseudo header checksum calculation correct in both 
   functions. StackTsk.h, UDP.h and TCP.h files were also modified to reflect these 
   changes.
8. Modified TCP.C file to include compile-time check of STACK_USE_TCP define.  If it is 
   not defined, an error will be displayed.
9. Removed an unnecessary call to MACDiscardRx() when an IP packet is received but 
   fails version, options length, or header checksum tests.
10. Changed LCD code to be compile time removable by undefining USE_LCD.


Fixes:
1. IPHeaderLen in IP.c is initialized properly now when IPGetHeader() is called.
2. Under some circumstances, HandleTCPSeg() would acknowlege, but throw valid received 
   TCP packets away, resulting in loss of application data.  An invalid comparison in 
   HandleTCPSeg() has been fixed to prevent this situation from occuring.
        *** Thanks go to Richard Shelquist for identifying this problem.
3. Fixed StackTsk.c file so that if a static IP address is used and the LINK is 
   removed, the node IP address is not cleared.
4. Invalid ICMP echo replies are no longer generated for echo requests with a data 
   length of 33 (one more than the configured maximum).
5. Changed MAX_OPTIONS_LEN from 20 to 40.  The maximum IP options length is now in 
   agreement with the IP RFC.
6. Changed IPSetRxBuffer() from a macro to a function.  The function takes into 
   account any options which may be present in the header of received IP packets.  
   Previously, possible options were not taken into account when calculating the 
   offset.


Known Problems:
1. Testing on the PICDEM.net demo board with the Realtek RTL8019AS Ethernet controller 
   has not been done.  Moving to the HPC Explorer demo board has resulted in pinout 
   and other hardware changes.
2. Sometimes when the FTP sever is used, an attempt to put a file is unsuccessful.  
   The problem may be caused when an HTTP request to GET a file is made at the wrong 
   time.
3. MACSetPMFilter(), MACDisablePMFilter(), and MACCopyRxToTx() have not been tested and 
   possibly do not work.
4. SNMP, TFTPc, LCD, SLIP modules have not been tested with this version.
5. The stack may behave incorrectly if compiled using the Hitech compiler with a high 
   optimizations setting.
6. Serial numbers >32K will be displayed on the serial port as a negative value when 
   C18 is used and the board is placed in configuration mode (RB0 button is depressed 
   on power up).
7. IP Gleaning may not get disabled when, through the RS232 configuration application, 
   DHCP and IP Gleaning are disabled.
8. The IP address being outputted out the RS232 port and through the Announce module 
   does not happen when the IP address is configured using IP Gleaning.
9. Multiple TX buffer support is not fully inplemented in the MAC layer, ENC28J60.c.  
   Stack behavior when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is defined may be unexpected.



********
v2.20.04.01:   9/24/03
********
1. Recreated MPLAB projects to avoid problems when source is not at \MCHPStack location.


********
v2.20.04:   9/5/03
********
Fixes:
1. Modified DHCPReset() in DHCP.c to not reset DHCP state machine if it was previously 
   disabled using DHCPDisable().  This would make sure that if DHCP module was enabled
   and application had run-time disabled DHCP and network cable is disconnected, 
   stack will not clear its IP address.

2. Rebuilt mib2bib.exe file with static library options.  This fixes problem where
   one tries to execute this exe, an error occurs about missing DLLs. 
   

********
v2.20.03:   
********
Improvements:
1. When DHCP is enabled, LINK is monitored and IP address is reset on disconnect.
   New IP configuration is obtained on LINK reconnect. - For RealTek only.
   Modified DHCP.c to add DHCPReset()
   Modified MAC.c to add MACIsLinked()
   Modified StackTsk.h to add BYTE_VAL def.
   
Changes:
1. Modified SMSC91c111.c to add empty MACIsLinked() - will be populated in next rev.
   
Bug Fixes:
1. Corrected DHCP logic to accept first DHCP offer instead of second response.
2. Corrected DHCP logic to check for chaddr in DHCP offer and accept one that
   matches with local MAC address.  This will fix problem where if multiple
   nodes were on bus and all requested DHCP address, all would accept response
   from one server instead of verifying who was intended node.
3. Fixed UDPClose() in UDP.c to use INVALID_UDP_PORT instead of INVALID_UDP_SOCKET
   because of which a closed socket would not be scanned correctly.
4. Modified UDP.h to use long contsant designators for INVALID_UDP_OPRT 
   to explicitly state that it is a long.   



********
v2.20.02:   
********
Beta version containing TFTP client module.

Addition:
1. TFTP Client module - See TFTPc.* and TFTPcDemo.c for more information.
   See MpTFTPcDemo and HtTFTPcDemo projects for build information.

Bug Fix:
1. UDPIsGetReady() was modified to overcome compiler rule where only 8-bit value was
   used to evaluate non-zero condition.
2. ARPResolve() in ARPTsk was fixed to clear Cache.IPAddr value.

********
v2.20.01:   
********
Bug fix:
1. Fixed SMSC91C111.c where MACInit() would hand if ethernet link is not detected.


********
v2.20:   
********
Bug Fixes:
1. General  - Removed most of harmless warnings.
2. C18Cfg.asm - Fixed "include" instead of "define".
3. DHCP.c   -   Increased DHCP_TIMEOUT_VAL to 2 seconds.
                Fixed problem where UDP active socket was not set before calling UDP 
functions
                in SM_DHCP_BROADCAST state.
4. MAC.c    -   Fixed MACIsTxReady() where under heavy traffic it would always return 
FALSE.                
                This fixes bug where all high level applications would stop 
transmitting.
5. TCP.c    -   Enabled portion of code that performs timeout logic even if 
TCP_NO_WAIT_ACK
                is defined.  This fixes bug where occasionally, tcp applications such as 
                HTTP server would stop working after few hours.
6. UDP.c    -   Fixed UDPGet() where it would return FALSE on last good byte.
                Fixed UDPProcess() where it was calculating incorrect length.
                
                Added bFirstRead flag with UDP sockets similar to TCP sockets
                so that whenever first UDP byte is read, MAC read pointer will be
                reset to begining of correct packet.
                This change fixes problem where if one transmits a packet while
                UDP packet is pending in a socket, next get to pending UDP socket would
                return wrong data. (This is apparent only when there is heavy network 
traffic)
                
Known Issues:
1. HiTech v8.20 PL4 with all optimization enabled may not work properly.
2. C18 "Static" and "Auto" mode may not be used - there are too many local variables to 
fit
    in standard stack of 256 bytes.  One may modify linker script file to avoid this 
limitation.

                

Improvements:
1. Modified TICK def. in Tick.h to unsigned long to support 32-bit wide SNMP tick.
2. Added SNMP Module (SNMP.c)
3. Added Two new demo projects - DemoSNMPApp and HtDemoSNMPApp.
4. Created MPLAB 6.X projects for different demo configurations.
5. MAC.c    -   Added MACGetTxOffset().
6. MPFS.c   -   Added MPFSSeek(), MPFSTell().
7. MPFSImg.*-   Rebuilt to reflect v2.20, footprint changes etc.
8. StackTsk.h-  Enhanced WORD_VAL, DWORD_VAL defs.
                Added STACK_USE_SNMP and related compile-time checks.
9. UDP.h    -   Added UDPSetTx and UDPSetRx macros.
                Moved UDP_SOCKET_INFO structure to header file.
10. WebSrvr.c-   Modifed MCHPStack version message and added DATE info to BoardSetup
                menu.
11. Added support for SMSC LAN91C111 10/100 Non-PCI ethernet controller 
            Use "SMSC91C111.C" instead of MAC.c.  
            "mpnicee_smsc" is a sample project that uses PIC18F8720 and SMSC NIC.
            "MasterDemo.c" is a main source file for above project that includes
            all modules - must use device with more than 32KB of memory.
            



********
v2.11:   
********
Bug Fixes:
1. Fixed dhcp.c to make it work with new C18 startup code.

Improvements:
1. Modified websrvr.c DownloadMPFS() to make use of compiler allocated XMODEM data block
   rather than use fixed address block starting at 0x400.


********
v2.10:   7/9/02
********
Bug Fixes:
1. Fixed HTTP Server bug where a form submission with empty parameter value would not 
   parse correctly.



********
v2.0:   5/22/02
********

********
New Modules:
********
1. Added UDP, DHCP, FTP and IP Gleaning
2. Added PICDEM.net LCD support
3. Added board setup through RS-232.

********
Improvements:
********
1. Optimized serial EEPROM access routines in terms of speed and size
    (Replaced ee256.* files with eeprom*.h)
2. Improved board setup through RS-232.

********
Known Issues:
********
1. LCD may not display properly on MCLR only.
   Workaround: 1. Debug XLCDInit() routine in "xlcdlh" 
               2. Always do POR reset.

2. SLIP connection is not very robust.
   Workaround: None at this time.

3. Hi-Tech Compiler: 
                1. Aggressive optimization breaks the functionality.
                   Workaround: Apply optimization listed in each source file comment 
header.
                2. In order to use V8.12, you will need to remove "FTP Server" from 
Ht*.pjt.
                   You will also need to disable all optimizations.

4. C18 Compler: 1. Static model does not compile.
                   Workaround: None at this time.
                2. Overlay model breaks the functionality.
                   Workaround: None at this time.
                3. All modules does not fit in 32KB memory.
                   Workaround: 1. None at this time.
                               2. Sample project disables some modules.
